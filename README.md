# CMB Decoder
This is a java based CMB file format parser, which will allow you to decode cmb files generated by CatalystEX software.

Currently, CMB files generated by CatalystEX 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 are supported.

## How To Use:
### Reading a CMB file and writing it back into another file:
```
CmbFile cmb = CmbParser.fromFile(new File("samples/modelA.cmb"));

CmbBuilder.writeCmbToFile(cmb, "samples/modelA_copy.cmb");
```

### Reading a CMB file and printing all of the commands in layer #33:

```
CmbFile cmb = CmbParser.fromFile(new File("samples/modelA.cmb"));

List<Layer> layers = cmb.getLayers();
Layer layer33 =  layers.get(33);
for(int i = 0; i < layer33.getSize(); i++) {
	System.out.println(layer33.getCommand(i));
}
```
